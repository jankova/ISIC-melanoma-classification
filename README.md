# SIIM-ISIC melanoma classification
https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification

## Goals and dataset
The goal is to predict whether a skin lesion is malignant or benign, based on its photograph.

For training we used the 2020 ISIC dataset, resized to 256x256 and triple-stratified:

https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/melanoma-256x256 

The dataset contains 33,126 images for training of which only 584 (1.8%) are malignant, resulting in high imbalance. Therefore we additionally consider a dataset of 4000 malignant-only images https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/malignant-v2-256x256.

Training was run using Tensorflow 2.3.0 on an AWS G4 instance. The model is a combination of a ConvNet architecture for training on images and a fully connected neural network for the metadata. 
The resulting features are concatenated and passed through a dense layer.
We experimented with several different types of architectures, re-training the last layers of pre-trained models including ResNet50, EfficientNetB1,B3,B4 and VGG16.

The output of the training epochs can be found in [03-main-training.ipynb](03-main-training.ipynb).

## Training summary
We ran a number of experiments, which suggested that in terms of model architecture, EfficientNets performed best in this task.

We further experimented with
1. adding additional 4000 examples of malignant-only images to the training data
2. adding class weights to the loss function
3. adjusting learning rates, architecture, image resolution
4. adding classical augmentations (rotations, flips, etc.)
5. adding hair augmentation

### Further improvements:
To obtain a high performing solution in this competetion, it helps to train several different EfficientNet architectures (B0-B7) with different datasets (ISIC 2020, 2019, 2018), image resolutions (from 256 to 1024), with and without data/hair augmentation.
